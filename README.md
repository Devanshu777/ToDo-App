## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
- Dark Themed UI: The app features a visually appealing dark-themed user interface, making it easy on the eyes and suitable for prolonged use.
- Search Functionality: The app includes a search box where users can type keywords to filter and find specific todo items from the list quickly.
- ToDo Item Status: When a ToDo item is completed, users can tap on the checkbox to mark it as done. The UI reflects the change by crossing out the text of the completed item.
- Deleting ToDo Items: To remove an unwanted ToDo item from the list, users can tap the delete button associated with that item.
- Data Model and Dummy Data: The ToDo class serves as the data model for a ToDo item, and it provides a static method todoList() that returns a predefined list of ToDo items for testing purposes.
